This script is intended for teachers and students.
If you are a teacher and frequently ask your students to write some Racket code in front of the class,
you can thank them / give them compliment with this script when they are done.

It produces simple asciiart robo-head saying encouraging words - like this one:

;__________
;| _    _  |    ______________
;|(^)  (^) |   /              |
;|    o    |  /  Nicely done! |
;|  \___/  |  \_______________|
;+---------+
