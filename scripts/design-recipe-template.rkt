    My second submitted Racket Quickscript

    it isn't using any additional Quickscript capabilities --
    but wanted to see if could I take the highlighted text, assume it
    is a function name, and build an HSU CS-111-compliant design recipe
    template for a function with that name

    The highlighted text is assumed to be the name of a function
    to be designed and written, and is replaced with an opening
    comment block containing an empty signature and purposes statement
    for that function, the beginnings of two check-expects for that
    function, and the beginnings of a functions header for that function,
    followed by an empty-template function body
