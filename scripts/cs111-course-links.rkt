    My third submitted Racket Quickscript

    It is blatantly adapted from/inspired from Stephen De Gabrielle's
    Racket Survey script, because that looked like such a neat capability
    (to go to a specific URL).
    
    And then it grew into look, one can make a QuickScript submenu of a specific
    course's related links... including a mailto: link, just to see if it would
    work!

    F20 SPECIFIC - will need to update for future semesters of CS 111
