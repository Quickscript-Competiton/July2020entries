# Quickscript Competition:

[Quickscript](https://www.cs.utah.edu/plt/snapshots/current/doc/quickscript/index.html) is the scripting functionality behind the DrRacket `Scripts` menu:

For the month of July we will be running a Quickscript competition: Write your own script and win prizes!
There will be weekly winners in categories to be determined by the judges and overall awards at the end of the month. 

We follow Racket's and the ACM's [Code of Conduct](https://racket-lang.org/friendly.html).


## There will be amazing prizes!

* If you participate once, you get stickers,
* if you participate twice time, you get also a mug,
* if you participate three times, you get also a t-shirt

(while stocks last. Note - prizes still available)
You can participate more than once.
