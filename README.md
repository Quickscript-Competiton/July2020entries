# Quickscript Competition:

[Quickscript](https://docs.racket-lang.org/quickscript) is the scripting functionality behind the DrRacket `Scripts` menu:

For the month of July we will be running a Quickscript competition: Write your own script and win prizes!
There will be weekly winners in categories to be determined by the judges and overall awards at the end of the month. 

We follow Racket's and the ACM's [Code of Conduct](https://racket-lang.org/friendly.html).


## There will be amazing prizes!
* An exclusive badge for your github profile recognising your efforts and contribution to the community. 
* Socks/Mugs/Hats/Stickers with the Racket logo - to be announced on Racket Users mailing list/google group.

Scripts licensed appropriately will be included in a package for installation and universal fame.

End date: 31-July
